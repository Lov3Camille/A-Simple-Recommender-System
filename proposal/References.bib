abstract = {We propose a method for induction of compact optimal recommendation policies based on discovery of frequent item-sets in a purchase database, followed by the application of standard decision tree learning algorithms for the purposes of simplification and compaction of the recommendation policies. Experimental results suggest that the structure of such policies can be exploited to partition the space of customer purchasing histories much more efficiently than frequent itemset discovery algorithms alone would allow.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates application of clustering to multi-criteria ratings as a method of improving the precision of top-N recommendations. With the advent of ecommerce sites that allow multi-criteria rating of items, there is an opportunity for recommender systems to use the additional information to gain a better understanding of user preference. This thesis proposes the use of the relevant set correlation model for a clustering-based collaborative filtering system. It is anticipated this novel system will handle large numbers of users and items without sacrificing the relevance of recommended items.},
